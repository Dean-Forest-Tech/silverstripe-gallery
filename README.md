This module was created by [i-lateral](http://www.i-lateral.com).

## Installation

The prefered method is via composer:

Alternativley download and add to:

Then run a `dev/build` (eithe from the browser of the command line).

## Usage

Once installed, you can add either a `Gallery Hub` or a `Gallery Page` to your site.

### Gallery Hub

Hub pages generate a thumbnail for each child `GalleryPage` with a link to view that gallery.

The thumbnail is generated based on the first image in the list

### Gallery Page

A gallery page allows you to upload images and then generates them as a thumbnail
gallery. Clicking on the thumbnail opens a modal/lightbox.

You can add a gallery to your site by creating a `GalleryPage` from within the CMS.

Under the `Gallery` tab, you can then upload as many images as needed.

#### Changing the width and height of images

If you wish to change the width and height of the gallery images (or thumbnails) loaded,
you can do this under the `Settings` tab on your `GalleryPage`.

You can set the following options:

* **Image Width** (default: 950): Width in PX of images loaded in the modal
* **Image Height** (default: 500): Height in PX of images loaded in the modal
* **Image Resize Type** (default: ratio): Type of resize to use on images
* **Background** (default: ffffff): If we use a padded image, set the background colour
* **Thumbnail Width** (default: 150): Width in PX of thumbnail images
* **Thumbnail Height** (default: 150): Height in PX of thumbnail images
* **Thumbnail Resize Type** (default: pad): Type of resize to use on thumbnails

Resize options are as follows:

* crop: Crop image to exact size
* pad: Pad image to size and add whitespace
* ratio: Perform a ratio resize of images
